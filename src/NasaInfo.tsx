        p2Contents="Beginning in 1946, the National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) began
        experimenting with rocket planes such as the supersonic Bell X-1.[14] In the early
        1950s, there was challenge to launch an artificial satellite for the International
        Geophysical Year (1957â€“1958). An effort for this was the American Project Vanguard.
        After the Soviet space program's launch of the world's first artificial satellite
        (Sputnik 1) on October 4, 1957, the attention of the United States turned toward
        its own fledgling space efforts. The U.S. Congress, alarmed by the perceived threat
        to national security and technological leadership (known as the Sputnik crisis),
        urged immediate and swift action; President Dwight D. Eisenhower counseled more
        deliberate measures. The result was a consensus that the White House forged among
        key interest groups, including scientists committed to basic research; the Pentagon
        which had to match the Soviet military achievement; corporate America looking for
        new business; and a strong new trend in public opinion looking up to space exploration."
